            Once you buy the package, you can have a look at the resumes of

            have. Browse through their details and shortlist the ones you think
            match your profile. You can see their contact details and reach out
            to each one of them. <br />
            We offer candidates from all locations. So if you want a candidate
            in one location and he is stationed in another city, you can talk to
            him about relocating. However, that is something you can discuss in
            the interview stage only.

            For smoother recruitments, you have to conduct the interviews of the
            candidates you think are suitable. Have a detailed discussion with
            them and explain the job responsibilities to them. You can also
            check their experience and expertise during this interview.
            <br />
            In the cases of chef and bartender kinds of profiles, you can ask
            for a practical evaluation. That means the candidate would come to
            your place and do the needful. It is easy for you to evaluate their
            credentials based on the practical interview.

            Discuss the pay and other details
          </p>
          <p className="mt-3 text-[18px] font-inter">
            After you have got your ideal candidate, you must discuss pay with
            him. It is possible that the candidate is based elsewhere, and your
            hotel is opening up at a different location. You can ask the
            candidate if he would be interested in shifting.
            <br />
            Here you should also tell the candidate that you will offer him free
            boarding and food during the employment. This is an essential
            criterion as the hospitality industry has rather rigorous shifts.
            You can also discuss other benefits and perks that you offer. This
            includes:
          </p>
          <ul className="pl-5 3xl:text-2xl font-inter text-[18px]">
            <li className="list-disc">Health insurance</li>
            <li className="list-disc">Bonus</li>
            <li className="list-disc">Performance bonus</li>
            <li className="list-disc">Yearly appraisal </li>
            <li className="list-disc">Weekly off</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="py-2 3xl:text-2xl font-inter text-[18px]">
            If the candidate finds all your terms and conditions appropriate, he
            can finalize the deal with you.

            Signing the papers
          </p>
          <p className="mt-3 text-[18px] font-inter">
            At this point, the candidate can come over and sign up the
            agreement. The paperwork should include all the details of the
            employment. If there is any kind of confusion, this is the point at
            which you can sort the same out. The pay package and the date of
            joining are also essential aspects that you have to include in these
            papers. <br />
            Once the papers are signed, be ready to welcome your hospitality
            staff on board. You can hire as many profiles as you want just by
            following the steps mentioned above. HospitalityFinder.in helps you
            plan and set up your hotel or restaurant with the most qualified and
            experienced staff.
