                    5 Tips you could use to make your professional hospitality staff productive
                </p>
                <p className="pt-5 md:pt-10">Running a hotel business is not an easy affair. There are a lot of things that could go wrong. Your staff, however, should be empowered to keep things going. But problems arise when the staff itself gets motivated. <br />
            A bad review or rumour-mongering anything could cause your staff to lose interest. You can, however, not let that happen as that impacts their productivity as well. Here we will tell you five tips that can be used to make a<b> global network of professional hospitality staff productive.</b>
                </p>
                <p className="text-xl py-5 font-semibold">Incentivize them </p>
                <p className="">
                    The hospitality industry thrives on good reviews. Similarly, your hospitality staff needs to know that they are doing the job perfectly. You could do so by offering bonuses for the hard work they put in. Or mark their achievements by awarding them a trophy or gift. People appreciate it when the company praises them. Especially during the peak season, such efforts boost the morale of<b> your experienced hospitality staff for hire.</b>
                </p>
                <p className="text-xl py-5 font-semibold">Practice accountability</p>
                <p className="">
                    Your staff will work better if they are held accountable for the jobs they do. If you praise them for their excellent work, they must be liable for punishment if they falter anywhere. This will inculcate a sense of responsibility in your staff. They would work to provide only high standard work as they know it will come back on them.
                    </p>
                <p className="text-xl py-5 font-semibold">Reduce micromanaging</p>
                <p className="">
                    If you have a habit of micromanaging, then it is time you stop doing that. Allot, your team, and members some of the simple tasks so that it reduces the burden on you.

                <p className="">
                    However hectic the work schedule encourages your team to take breaks in between. This would reduce the over mounting stress of work. Side by side it will give the staff an impression that they are well cared for. Ensure you have enough staff to cover up if any staff needs a break.                     </p>
                <p className="text-xl py-5 font-semibold">Add the happiness quotient</p>
