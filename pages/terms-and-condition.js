            <p className="text-xl py-5 font-semibold">Payment and Charges</p>
            <p>
              On Hospitality finder, we operate on the basis of packages. You
              know your budget, and you can choose a package based on that. If
              you need more resumes after the package you have chosen, you can
              intimate us. The salaries of the candidates are mentioned with
              each resume. You can decide which candidate matches the package
              you are willing to pay. <br />
              We would like to tell you that the rates of the cooks, chefs,
              bartenders, and reception staff all depend on their qualifications
              and past experience. If there is any specific cuisine, you can
              search the resumes on the basis of that. <br />
              The Hospitality finder management decides the package rates. There
              is no way we can change these rates for any client. Do not expect
              us to offer you a discount on the package rates. All our
              candidates are verified and trustworthy with the work assigned.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl py-5 font-semibold">
              Refund/ Cancellation Rules
            </p>
            <p>
              You will be provided the package benefits once you have made the
              payment. Post that, it is up to you how and what kind of resumes
              you want to search for. There is no time limit to using the
              resumes offered as part of the package. <br />
              <br />
              However, if you choose not to use the service, we will not issue a
              refund for the same. You are advised to go through the full
              details of how we operate before signing up. We assure you that
              the candidates we offer are qualified and experienced to handle
              any kind of job. <br />
              <br />
              You cannot cancel the package purchased. Neither will we issue you
              a refund in case you have not used the service. When buying the
              package read our FAQâ€™s to get complete understanding of how our
              platform works. <br />
              <br />
              If you do not like the candidates and cannot close the deal, we
              cannot help you. However, we go out of our way to provide you with
              the best housekeeping staff possible. All of them are
              double-checked and are experienced in the required fields.{" "}

            <p>
              Hospitality finder is not the employer in this case. We are only
              introducing you to the employees who are willing to work for new
              employers. Though most of the candidates we have are verified, we
              suggest you also make your own inquiries. We at Hospitality finder
              do all the background checks that are required, but we are not
              responsible for any wrong information they have given. You can do
              a double reference and background check if you are not satisfied.
              <br />
              Our job is just to make you acquainted with the employees. If at
              any point the hospitality staff causes any loss or expense, we are
              not responsible for the same. Once you shortlist the candidate,
              you have discussions with him. <br />
              If the deal does not fall through, we cannot help you out. You
              must ensure that you pick candidates who totally match your
              expectations before proceeding ahead.

            <p>
              The number of resumes you will receive is dependent on the package
              you choose. You can go to the Packages page to know more. At no
              point can you ask for more resumes. However, you can repurchase
              the package if you feel your job is incomplete. <br />
              <br />
              You can contact us at any time if you face difficulties in looking
              for suitable candidates. Our customer service reps will help you

            <p>
              When you buy a package, you are entitled to pay the entire amount
              in one go. This is fixed and final, and you cannot expect us to
              modify the same. Only after the full payment is completed can you
              search the profiles and look for the candidates.
              <br />
              Hospital Finder accepts your payments through any of the
              below-mentioned methods:

              not be charged extra.
